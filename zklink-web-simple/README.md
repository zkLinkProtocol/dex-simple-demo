# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup server endpoint

Before building the frontend project, it is necessary to deploy the server first to assemble transactions and send them to zkLink.

Once the server is deployed, ensure that the `REACT_APP_SERVER_ENDPOINT` in the `.env.testnet` file at the root directory of the frontend project is correct.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`

Install dependencies.

### `yarn start:testnet`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8880](http://localhost:8880) to view it in the browser.
